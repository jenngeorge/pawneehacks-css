# Style your own landing page

## Setup
- First, add the style link tag to the `head` section of index.html.
It should look like this
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
```
- Copy the `RESET SECTION` from the top of [the demo css file](../lecture/demo/styles.css) and paste this section into the top of your
project's `style.css` file.

Now you're ready to get styling!

## Navbar
## Hero Section
## Additional Information Sections

## Bonus: Make your landing page live with github pages
